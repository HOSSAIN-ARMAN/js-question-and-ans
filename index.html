Q1=> value is small unit of information and the variable store this information.
Q2=> there are 2 type of data types the one is premetive an the another is object data type ex: object = let obj = { data: "none"} and premetive let data = "none"
Q3 => there are 7 premetive data type like string(let = "hello"), number (contain integer, float, double), boolen (logical data type like ture or false),
undefine(varialbe called but not defiend like let data;), null (same mening of undefine), symbol (unique can not change),
bigInt(containe large integer than the number int can hold) remember one thing value has type but not variable 
Q4=> when you assign cont variable then you can not reassign value;
Q5=> basic introduce is let, const, var here let is using when you are need to change value and on the other side constant is uses for if you do not need to change value
Q6=> difference type converion and coercion here conversion means convert string to number like 
    let data = "2000"
    console.log(Number(data))
   on the other hand coercion is like console.log('i ama' + 20 + 'years old') so here the plus operator is coercion another example console.log('30' - '10' - 5) 
   here the ans is 15 here minous operator do another thing so this is type coercion 
   example of coercion [ let n = '10' + 1
                          n = n-1 the ans is 10
    console.log(2+3+4+'5') the ans is "95"
   console.log('10' - '4' - '3' - 2 + '5') the ans is "15"
Q7=> there are five falsy value like 0, '', undefine, null, NAN
