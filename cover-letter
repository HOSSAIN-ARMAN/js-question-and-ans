Dear HR,
First of all, I'd like to thank you for finding the time to read my cover letter and resume, I received B.Sc in computer science from a daffodil international university. I try to learn at least one new technology every day also try to stay updated with the new technology and I am hungry to improve my skills and knowledge.

My previous workplace name is Skylarksoft where I learned lots of things and worked as a team member and collaborate effectively. I took parts in projects from beginning to end in ERP inventory as a programmer and role played report generate, calculation programming, code optimization, bug fixing, and writing beautiful documented code.
Likewise, I am not a person who quits and gives up and strong work ethic in myself. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

 Sincerely,
 Arman Hossain
